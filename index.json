However, this phe- nomenon has not been properly understood in the context of sketch- based linear classifiers, typically used in memory-constrained para- digms, which rely on random projections of the features for model compression. In this paper, we propose novel Fast-Gradient-Sign Method (FGSM) attacks for sketched classifiers in full, partial, and black-box information settings with regards to their internal param- eters. We perform extensive experiments on the MNIST dataset to characterize their robustness as a function of perturbation budget. Our results suggest that, in the full-information setting, these clas- sifiers are less accurate on unaltered input than their uncompressed counterparts but just as susceptible to adversarial attacks. But in more realistic partial and black-box information settings, sketching improves robustness while having lower memory footprint.","tags":[],"title":"Robustness of Sketched Linear Classifiers to Adversarial Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arpit Merchant","Ananth Mahadevan","Michael Mathioudakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663003235,"objectID":"ef460a14dda71dcd025691b72ba6aa1d","permalink":"http://www.ananthmahadevan.com/publication/jane/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T17:21:17.561399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jane/","section":"publication","summary":"The task of node classification concerns a network where nodes are associated with labels, but labels are known only for some of the nodes. The task consists of inferring the unknown labels given the known node labels, the structure of the network, and other known node attributes. Common node classification approaches are based on the assumption that adjacent nodes have similar attributes and, therefore, that a node‚Äôs label can be predicted from the labels of its neighbors. While such an assumption is often valid (e.g., for political affiliation in social networks), it may not hold in some cases. In fact, nodes that share the same label may be adjacent but differ in their attributes, or may not be adjacent but have similar attributes. In this work, we present JANE (Jointly using Attributes and Node Embeddings), a novel and principled approach to node classification that flexibly adapts to a range of settings wherein unknown labels may be predicted from known labels of adjacent nodes in the network, other node attributes, or both. Our experiments on synthetic data highlight the limitations of benchmark algorithms and the versatility of JANE. Further, our experiments on seven real datasets of sizes ranging from 2.5K to 1.5M nodes and edge homophily ranging from 0.86 to 0.29 show that JANE scales well to large networks while also demonstrating an up to 20% improvement in accuracy compared to strong baseline algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Scalably Using Node Attributes and Graph Structure for Node Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ananth Mahadevan","Michael Mathioudakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654905600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663003235,"objectID":"61a48f5a3e68474aeda389d45f81172a","permalink":"http://www.ananthmahadevan.com/publication/unlearning-pipelines/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T17:21:17.310139Z","relpermalink":"/publication/unlearning-pipelines/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine unlearning is the task of updating machine learning (ML) models after a subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the task are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency (i.e., they should effectively ‚Äúunlearn‚Äù deleted data, but in a way that does not require excessive computational effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of deletions). Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount of approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the spirit of ‚Äúthe right to be forgotten‚Äù have given rise to requirements for certifiability (i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has indeed been unlearned by the ML model). In this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art approximate unlearning methods for logistic regression and demonstrate the trade-offs between efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In implementing this study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a common unlearning pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six real-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the effect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and the performance of each unlearning method in different settings. We also propose a practical online strategy to determine when the accumulated error from approximate unlearning is large enough to warrant a full retraining of the ML model.","tags":[],"title":"Certifiable Unlearning Pipelines for Logistic Regression: An Experimental Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Ordozgiti","Ananth Mahadevan","Antonis Matakos","Aristides Gionis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641254400,"objectID":"4b311f80728057b19958bd0ab0fee94f","permalink":"http://www.ananthmahadevan.com/publication/minsumsim/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/minsumsim/","section":"publication","summary":"When searching for information in a data collection, we are often interested not only in finding relevant items, but also in assembling a diverse set, so as to explore different concepts that are present in the data. This problem has been researched extensively. However, finding a set of items with minimal pairwise similarities can be computationally challenging, and most existing works striving for quality guarantees assume that item relatedness is measured by a distance function. Given the widespread use of similarity functions in many domains, we believe this to be an important gap in the literature. In this paper we study the problem of finding a diverse set of items, when item relatedness is measured by a similarity function. We formulate the diversification task using a flexible, broadly applicable minimization objective, consisting of the sum of pairwise similarities of the selected items and a relevance penalty term. To find good solutions we adopt a randomized rounding strategy, which is challenging to analyze because of the cardinality constraint present in our formulation. Even though this obstacle can be overcome using dependent rounding, we show that it is possible to obtain provably good solutions using an independent approach, which is faster, simpler to implement and completely parallelizable. Our analysis relies on a novel bound for the ratio of Poisson-Binomial densities, which is of independent interest and has potential implications for other combinatorial-optimization problems. We leverage this result to design an efficient randomized algorithm that provides a lower-order additive approximation guarantee. We validate our method using several benchmark datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms the greedy approaches that are commonly used in the literature.","tags":[],"title":"Provable randomized rounding for minimum-similarity diversification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ananth Mahadevan","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
